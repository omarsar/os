## Chapter 3: Process Management (Distributed Environment)

- There are two types of models in the distributed environment, where the operating system operates and executes jobs differently: **Workstation Model** and **Processor Pool Model**. CPU allocation works different in the distributed environment. 


- In the workstation model, users are assigned a different workstation to operate in the network. Here every user has access to processing power. 


- In the processor pool model, users are provided a high-end terminal and connected to a high-end server (with many CPUs). In processor pool model, users are not provided access to processing power. The processing power is kept at a central location or the high-end server in this case.

 
- In the distributed environment there are two types of CPU allocation techniques: **Non-migratory** and **Migratory**. 


- **Non-migratory** is static in nature. In this environment, the processor in which a job is scheduled to execute is fixed and not editable. That means, the job remains in that process for its entire life time.


- In the **migratory** model, a process can be shifted for execution from one processor to another processor. The shifting of jobs is sometimes necessary to improve the system's performance. 


- When tasks are divided into subtasks what are the requirements for the entire process to execute concurrently?


- **Concurrent Processing** - Statements make up a particular tasks. The aim of the operating system is to find out how many statement of a task can be executed concurrently or simultaneously. If a statement doesn't depend on another, then it can be concurrently be processed with another statement that also doesn't depend on another statement; so both statement cannot depend on another statement.


- Given the example of statements below,

| Si | task      |
|----|-----------|
| S1 | a = x + y |
| S2 | b = z + 1 |
| S3 | c = a + b |
| S4 | d = c - 1 |

- S1 and S2 can be processed concurrently since they don't depend on any of the other statements. Conversely, S3 and S4 cannot be processed concurrently since they must wait for S1 and S2 to finish executing.


- This whole process of what gets to be executed first can be represented using **directed graphs** or more accurately ***precedence graph**, where one node (represented as a statement) points to another if it required by another node.


- The **read set** of a given statement is the set of variables which are only referred in ***S(i)***; their values are not modified by ***S(i)***. The ***write set*** is the set of variables which are referred and modified by ***S(i)***.


- ***R(S1) = {x, y}*** and ***W(S1) = {a}***; ***R(S2) = {z}*** and ***W(S2) = {b}***;***R(S3) = {a, b}*** and ***W(S3) = {c}***; ***R(S4) = {c}*** and ***W(S3) = {d}***.


- A concurrent scenario: If ***R(S(i))*** (read set of si) and ***W(S(j))*** (write set of sj) do not intersect with each other; If ***W(S(i))*** and ***W(S(j))*** do not intersect; If ***W(S(i))*** and ***R(S(j))*** do not intersect; If ***R(S(i))*** and ***R(S(j))*** does or doesn't intersect.


- Concurrents tasks, regardless of the order in which they are executed, will produce the same overall output. 


- **Precedence relation** refers to the relationship of nodes (statements) within a precedence graph.


- Algorithm for implementing concurrent processing (an example):
  - The arcs of the precedence graph: S1 --> S2; S1 --> S3; S2 --> S4; S4 --> S5; S4 --> S6; S5 --> S7; S6 --> S7; S3 --> S7.


  ```
  begin
    count = 3 // three processes are to be joined at a point
    S1
    fork L1 //creates two processes: one starts execution at L1 (L1: S3) and one that follows L1
    S2 
    S4
    fork L2 //(L2:S6)
    S5
    join count // L3: decrease count by 1; if count != 0 then quit else continue
    S7
  end
  ```

- The **join** statement terminates a process then decreases count by 1. When count becomes 0 then it proceeds to the other process in the graph. Essentially, the join statement is taking all the processes, terminating them and exiting from to one final process (S7 in the example provided above).

- There might be cases where the processes can be joined to multiple points instead of just one point as in the example provided above. In such cases, defining a single count variable in not sufficient.

- Algorithm for an example that uses multiple joins:
  - The arcs representing the precedence graph: S1 --> S2; S1 --> S3; S2 --> S4; S2 --> S5; S4 --> S6; S5 --> S6; S3 --> S7; S6 --> S7.


  ```
  begin S1
    count_1 = 2
    count_2 = 2
    fork L1 // L1:S3 (goto L4)
    S2
    fork L2 // L2:S5 (goto L3)
    S4
    join count_1 //L3
    S6
    join count_2 //L4
    S7
  end
  ```
