## Chapter 6: Deadlock

- __Review:__ The main function of the operating system is to manage the resources which are to be shared by more than one processes. 

- Given two processes _P1_ and _P2_, requiring two resources _A_ and _B_... There could be a scenario where _P1_ has acquired resource _A_ and is waiting for resource _B_, which has been acquired by another process _P2_, which is also waiting for the same process that was initially acquired by _P1_. This situation leads to a __deadlock__ where both processes will never complete since they both depend on resources which were previously acquired by either one them. 

- The deadlock problem can also be modeled this way: _P1_ acquires _A_ and _P2_ acquires B; _P1_ needs _B_ to complete and _P2_ needs _A_ to complete. 

- To avoid deadlock the assigning of resources to processes needs an efficient assigning mechanism. This can done using the concept of requesting where a process that needs a resource must first request to use that resource. A life cycle or sequence of a request for a resource: __Request__ --> __Use__ --> __Release__.

- __Deadlock Definition__:
> A set of processes is said to be in deadlock when every process in the set waits for an event that can only be caused by another process in the set.

- In our previous example, _P1_ is waiting for the __release event__ by the other process _P2_.

- There are four conditions for the occurrence of a deadlock:
    - 1. __Mutual Exclusion__ - at least one resource in the system which cannot be shared simultaneously by more than one process.
    - 2. __Hold and Wait__ - a process is holding and waiting for a resource.
    - 3. __No preemption__ - no interrupt of the process running.
    - 4. __Circular Wait__ - an extension of Hold and Wait. 

- If we can ensure that one of the condition from the list above is not present, then we can say that the system is deadlock free. 

- In a system, we can have the following resources:
    + Finite number of resources.
    + Various types of resources.
    + Every type has a number of identical resource instances.

- A deadlock situation can be represented using a graph technique (Resource Allocation Graph). Given a graph G = (V,E), Vertices (V) represent processes and resource type. Edges (E) represent request edges (_Pi_, _Rj_) and allocation edges (_Rj_, _Pi_). 

- Given the processes _P1_, _P2_ and _P3_; and the following resources _R1_, _R2_, _R3_ and _R4_. _R1_ and _R3_ have one resource instance while _R2_ and _R4_ each have 2 and 4 instances, respectively. Below are the following requests and allocations:

```Pascal
P1 --> R1; // request
P1 <-- R2(2); // instance 2
P2 <-- R1; // allocation
P2 --> R3;
P2 <-- R2(1);
P3 <-- R3;
```

- The above situation doesn't present a deadlock.

- If we modify the list of allocation and requests as the following:

```Pascal
P1 --> R1; // request
P1 <-- R2(2); // instance 2
P2 <-- R1; // allocation
P2 --> R3;
P2 <-- R2(1);
P3 <-- R3;
__P3 --> R2;__ // this request presents a deadlock; there is not enough instances in R2
```

- If there is a cycle in the graph, __there is a possibility__ of a deadlock, especially if there is only _one instance of a resource type_. 

- Deadlocks are better handling using an avoid strategy rather than detecting and killing processes. 

- There are three strategies for dealing with deadlock:
  + 1. __Deadlock Prevention__ - in this approach, the system prevents deadlock by breaking any of the four criteria that make up a deadlock. Restriction on the way processes request resources. 
  + 2. __Deadlock Avoidance__ - no restriction on the way processes request resources; such method avoids the cycle that leads to deadlock. 
  + 3. __Deadlock Detection and Recovery__


- Deadlock Prevention and the four criteria:
  + ME - cannot be broken 
  + Hold and Wait - when a process requests a resource, a condition can be placed for that process to release any resources that is has acquired before. Another way is to have a process execute only when it has requested and acquired all necessary resources (inefficient use of resources). 
  + No preemption - Given the following scenario: _Pi_ --> _Rj_ --> _Pj_; _Pi_ is not allowed to request any other resource if _Rj_ is being held by another process. Additionally, _Pi_ must release all other resources which it had acquired before. 
  + Circular Wait: Allows the process to request resources in a particular order. Establish a mapping function to achieve this.
